  As a PhD candidate at Radboud University, under the supervision of Faegheh Hasibi (Radboud University) and Evangelos Kanoulas (University of Amsterdam), I study LLMs and their role in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. My research is part of the LESSEN project, which aims to develop a Dutch national chatbot to be deployed by major companies such as KPN, bol.com, and Albert Heijn. I am also a guest researcher at KPN, where I work on applying uncertainty estimation techniques to improve the trustworthiness of RAG systems in real-world scenarios.

  My research interests lie in data generation using LLMs, as well as enhancing the reliability and interpretability of RAG through uncertainty estimation. I have over eight years of experience in data engineering, back-end development, and software engineering, and have published multiple papers at prestigious conferences during my PhD and MSc.

  I recently began a collaboration with Mohammad Aliannejadi (University of Amsterdam) and Hamed Zamani (University of Massachusetts Amherst) to create challenging benchmarks for evaluating RAG systems. My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of information retrieval and LLM-based systems, while also ensuring their practical impact in real-world applications.
