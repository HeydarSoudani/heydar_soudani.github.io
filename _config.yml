  As a PhD candidate at Radboud University, under the supervision of Faegheh Hasibi (Radboud University) and Evangelos Kanoulas (University of Amsterdam), I study LLMs and their role in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. My research is part of the LESSEN project, which aims to develop a Dutch national chatbot to be deployed by major companies such as KPN, bol.com, and Albert Heijn. I am also a guest researcher at KPN, where I work on applying uncertainty estimation techniques to improve the trustworthiness of RAG systems in real-world scenarios.

  My research interests lie in data generation using LLMs, as well as enhancing the reliability and interpretability of RAG through uncertainty estimation. I have over eight years of experience in data engineering, back-end development, and software engineering, and have published multiple papers at prestigious conferences during my PhD and MSc.

  I recently began a collaboration with Mohammad Aliannejadi (University of Amsterdam) and Hamed Zamani (University of Massachusetts Amherst) to create challenging benchmarks for evaluating RAG systems. My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of information retrieval and LLM-based systems, while also ensuring their practical impact in real-world applications.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            Large Language Models (LLMs) are valued for their strong performance across various tasks, but they also produce inaccurate or misleading outputs. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) quantifies the model's confidence and helps users assess response reliability. However, existing UE methods have not been thoroughly examined in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the input prompt includes non-parametric knowledge. This paper shows that current UE methods cannot reliably assess correctness in the RAG setting. We further propose an axiomatic framework to identify deficiencies in existing methods and guide the development of improved approaches. Our framework introduces five constraints that an effective UE method should meet after incorporating retrieved documents into the LLM's prompt. Experimental results reveal that no existing UE method fully satisfies all the axioms, explaining their suboptimal performance in RAG. We further introduce a simple yet effective calibration function based on our framework, which not only satisfies more axioms than baseline methods but also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness.

        sub_title: "Fine tuning vs. retrieval augmented generation for less popular knowledge"       
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            Language Models (LMs) memorize a vast amount of factual knowledge, exhibiting strong performance across diverse tasks and domains. However, it has been observed that the performance diminishes when dealing with less-popular or low-frequency concepts and entities, for example in domain specific applications. The two prominent approaches to enhance the performance of LMs on low-frequent topics are: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning (FT) over synthetic data. This paper explores and evaluates the impact of RAG and FT on customizing LMs in handling low-frequency entities on question answering tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on twelve LMs of varying size and type and different FT methods, data augmentation, and retrieval models. Our findings indicate that while FT boosts the performance across entities of varying popularity, RAG surpasses FT by a large margin particularly for least popular factual knowledge. Additionally, the success of both RAG and FT approaches is amplified by improving retrieval and data augmentation techniques. Fine tuning, while beneficial for small LMs, requires extensive resources. To address this issue, we propose the new Stimulus RAG approach that surpasses the effectiveness of fine tuning based approaches, thereby eliminating the need for the costly data augmentation and fine tuning step for enriching LMs with less popular factual knowledge.
